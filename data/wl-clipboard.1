.SH NAME
wl-clipboard \- Wayland copy and paste command line utiltites
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wl-copy
[\fB--primary\fR]
[\fB--paste-once\fR]
[\fB--foreground\fR]
[\fB--clear\fR]
[\fB--type \fImime/type\fR]
[\fItext\fR...]

.B wl-paste
[\fB--primary\fR]
[\fB--no-newline\fR]
[\fB--list-types\fR]
[\fB--type \fImime/type\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwl-copy\fR copies the given \fItext\fR to the Wayland clipboard.
If no \fItext\fR is given, \fBwl-copy\fR copies data from its standard input.
.PP
\fBwl-paste\fR pastes data from the Wayland clipboard to its standard output.
.PP
Although \fBwl-copy\fR and \fBwl-paste\fR are particularly optimized for plain
text and other textual content formats, they fully support content of arbitrary
MIME types. \fBwl-copy\fR automatically infers the type of the copied content by
running \fBxdg-mime\fR(1) on it. \fBwl-paste\fR tries its best to pick a type to
paste based on the list of offered MIME types and the extension of the file it's
pasting into. If you're not satisfied with the type they pick or don't want to
rely on this implicit type inference, you can explicitly specify the type to use
with the \fB--type\fR option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--primary
Use the "primary" clipboard instead of the regular clipboard. This uses the
private GTK+ primary selection protocol. See
.UR https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/PrimarySelection
the GNOME Wiki page on primary selection under Wayland
.UE
for more details.
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--paste-once
Only serve one paste request and then exit. Unless a clipboard manager
specifically designed to prevent this is in use, this has the effect of clearing
the clipboard after the first paste, which is useful for copying sensitive data
such as passwords. Note that this may break pasting into some clients, in
particular pasting into XWayland windows is known to break when this option is
used.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--foreground
By default, \fBwl-copy\fR forks and serves data requests in the background; this
option overrides that behavior, causing \fBwl-copy\fR to run in the foreground.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--clear
Instead of copying anything, clear the clipboard so that nothing is copied.
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--no-newline
Do not append a newline character after the pasted clipboard content. This
option is automatically enabled for non-text content types.
.TP
\fB-t\fI mime/type\fR, \fB--type\fI mime/type
Override the automatically selected MIME type. For \fBwl-copy\fR this option
controls which type \fBwl-copy\fR will offer the content as. For \fBwl-paste\fR
it controls which of the offered types \fBwl-paste\fR will request the content
in. In addition to specific MIME types such as \fIimage/png\fR, \fBwl-paste\fR
also accepts generic type names such as \fItext\fR and \fIimage\fR which make it
automatically pick some offered MIME type that matches the given generic name.
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--list-types
Instead of pasting the selection, output the list of MIME types it is offered
in.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
WAYLAND_DISPLAY
Specifies what Wayland server \fBwl-copy\fR and \fBwl-paste\fR should connect
to. This is the same environment variable that you pass to other Wayland
clients, such as graphical aplications, that connect to this Wayland server. It
is normally set up automatically by the graphical session and the Wayland
compositor. See
.BR wl_display_connect (3)
for more details.
.TP
WAYLAND_DEBUG
When set to \fB1\fR, causes the \fBwayland-client\fR(7) library to log every
interaction \fBwl-copy\fR and \fBwl-paste\fR make with the Wayland compositor to
stderr.
